Collect mobility patterns and give mobility information to users

in this project, we collected some data from mobilita dynamica application that related to coordinate of trips that persons used this application.In fact final purpose of project was dynamic label zone and determining purpose of trips. first of all we prepared data for using machine learning algorithm to make a model for next prediction. algorithm of machin learning that we used was random forest and to improve our accuracy we used grid search to select best parameter to get appropriate resault with accuracy.also we labeled the zones of Piedmont according to number of trips and attraction place in each zone .the tools that we used were Python and mongodb.
